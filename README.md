[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/candig/go-model-service)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/candig/go-model-service)

## Quick Start

Once you have [installed the stack](#installing-the-stack), run the following commands (as described in [Scripted Installation](#scripted-installation-of-the-go-model-service) and [Running the Service](#running-the-service)):

1. Checkout this go-model-service into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG` via:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG
  $ git checkout https://github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service.git
  $ cd go-model-service
  ```
2. Run the installation script from the project root directory:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service
  $ ./install.sh
  ```
3. From the project root directory, run the server on a port of your choosing (eg. port 3000):
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service
  $ ./main --port=3000
  ```

## Stack

- [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database backend
- [Go](https://golang.org/) (Golang) backend
- Gobuffalo [pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) is used as an orm-like for interfacing between the go code and the sqlite3 database. The `soda` CLI auto-generates boilerplate Go code for models and migrations, as well as performing migrations on the database. `fizz` files are used for defining database migrations in a Go-like syntax (see [syntax documentation](https://github.com/markbates/pop/tree/master/fizz).)
- [Go-swagger](https://goswagger.io/) auto-generates boilerplate Go code from a `swagger.yml` API definition. [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) tooling is based on the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification.
- [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html) is used for dependency management, specifically for libraries imported by Go code in the project.
- [genny](https://github.com/CanDIG/genny) is a code-generation solution to generics in Go.
- Gobuffalo [validate](https://github.com/gobuffalo/validate) is a framework used for writing custom validators. Some of their validators in the `validators` package are used as-is.

## Installation

Following the [installation of the stack](#installing-the-stack), There are two sets of installation instructions provided for this project.

1. The [Descriptive Installation](#descriptive-installation-of-the-go-model-service) of this project is verbose so as to offer a tutorial on which aspects of the server backend are auto-generated by tools in the stack, and which files act as configuration to this auto-generation step. You can learn more about the code-generating tools employed here in the [For Developers](#for-developers) section of this README.

2. The [Scripted Installation](#scripted-installation-of-the-go-model-service) of this project hides the individual installation steps in a script and allows for a quick-start approach to running the server.

### Installing the Stack

Prior to installing new programs, run `$ which <program-name>` to check if it is already installed on your machine. If there is a blank output rather than a path to the program binary, it needs to be installed.

See `install_dep.sh` for an example of the installation of steps 3-7. It s not recommended that you run this script locally, as some of these programs may already be installed on your system and the version of some tools may matter (eg. Go-swagger v0.16.0).

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). Make sure to set up the `$PATH` and `$GOPATH` environment variables according to [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/), and to understand the expected contents of the three `$GOPATH` subdirectories: `$GOPATH/src`, `$GOPATH/pkg`, and `$GOPATH/bin`.
2. [Install gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/).
3. [Install sqlite3](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm).
4. [Install dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html).
5. [Install go-swagger](https://goswagger.io/install.html) (release 0.16.0 strongly recommended.)
6. [Install pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop). See the [Unnoficial Pop Book](https://andrew-sledge.gitbooks.io/the-unofficial-pop-book/content/installation.html) for instructions. Make sure to include sqlite3 support with `tags sqlite` in your installation commands, as follows:
  ```
  $ go get -u -v -tags sqlite github.com/gobuffalo/pop/...
  $ go install -tags sqlite github.com/gobuffalo/pop/soda
  ```
7. [Install genny](https://github.com/CanDIG/genny#genny---generics-for-go).

### Descriptive Installation of the Go-Model-Service

1. Checkout this go-model-service into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG` via:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG
  $ git checkout https://github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service.git
  $ cd go-model-service
  ```
2. In the root directory of this project (ie. the directory where `Gopkg.lock` and `Gopkg.toml` are found) use the `dep` CLI tool to install all project import dependencies in a new `vendor` directory. See this README's [developers' notes for dep](#dep) for an explanation of the `-vendor-only` option used here.
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service
  $ dep ensure -vendor-only
  ```
3. Create a sqlite3 development database and migrate it to the schema defined in the `model-vs/data` directory, using the pop CLI tool `soda`:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service/model-vs/data
  $ soda create -e development
  $ soda migrate up -e development
  ```
4. Generate the boilerplate code necessary for handling API requests, from the `model-vs/api/swagger.yml` template file, with the Go-swagger CLI tool `swagger`. The following commands will generate a server named `variant-service`. This name is important for maintaining compatibility with the `configure_variant_service.go` middleware configuration file.
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service/model-vs/api
  $ swagger generate server -A variant-service swagger.yml
  ```
5. Run a script to generate resource-specific request handlers for middleware, from the generic handlers defined in the `model-vs/api/generics` package, using the CanDIG-maintained CLI tool `genny`:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service/model-vs/api
  $ ./generate_handlers.sh
  ```
6. Now that all the necessary boilerplate code has been auto-generated, compile the server by running:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service
  $ go build -tags sqlite model-vs/api/cmd/variant-service-server/main.go
  ```

  $ cd go-model-service
  ```

2. Run the installation script from the project root directory:
  ```
  $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service
  $ ./install.sh
  ```

## Running The Service

From the project root directory, run the server on a port of your choosing (eg. port 3000):

## For Developers

For your ease of adjustment to developing on this stack, and in particular to the amount of code generation involved in this Go project, instructions for using the code-gen tools have been provided here.

Please note that most auto-generated code has been excluded from this repository, and that instead there are instructions for generating this code locally provided in the [Descriptive Installation](#descriptive-installation-of-the-go-model-service) section of this README. Binary files such as main and development.sqlite have also been excluded from this repository.
The exclusions of these auto-generated and binary files is considered to be best form for version control repository maintenance. However, auto-generated files that are *not* generally re-generated (and are therefore safe to edit) should be pushed to this repository. `model-vs/api/restapi/configure_variant_service.go` and the `model-vs/data/models` package are examples of such safe-to-edit auto-generated code.

### Dep

In the initial installation of the service, the vendor-building step is run with `$ dep ensure -vendor-only`. This is to avoid modification of Gopkg.lock, which contains information about vital sub-packages for go-swagger that can not be explicitly constrained in Gopkg.toml.

For example, package "github.com/go-openapi/runtime/flagext" is required by go-swagger but is *not* solved into Gopkg.lock if `dep ensure` is run prior to `swagger validate`. Therefore it is important to read the existing Gopkg.lock file in the initial installation, rather than solve for a new one.

For more information, see the [dep documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/ensure-mechanics.html).

### Go-Swagger

Go-Swagger is a tool that automatically generates the boilderplate Go code needed to build a server, based on the API definitions for the service being provided by that server.

See [goswagger.io](https://goswagger.io/) for installation instructions, tutorials, use-cases, etc. If you find yourself having trouble with the installation, check the [prerequisites](https://goswagger.io/generate/requirements.html). The [Todo List Tutorial](https://goswagger.io/tutorial/todo-list.html) (Simple Server) is a good place to start if you've never used the go-swagger before. 

Go-Swagger uses Swagger 2.0, which is based on the OpenAPI specification. "Swagger" and "OpenAPI" are often used interchangeably, which can be confusing when trying to learn the pertinent tool or set up your environment. See [this post](https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/) for an explanation of the relationship between the two.

#### Generating The Server

The API definitions are written by the developer in a `swagger.yml` file. To validate that the `swagger.yml` file follows the specification, run
`$ swagger validate <path-to-target-swagger.yml>`.

To auto-generate a server based on the entities and endpoints described in the `swagger.yml` file, run
`$ swagger generate server -A <server-name> <path-to-target-swagger.yml>.`
For example, for this service, from the `go-model-service/model-vs/api` directory, you would run the following to re-generate the server:
`$ swagger generate server -A model-vs swagger.yml`

The backend can now be implemented by modifying the endpoint handlers in `restapi/configure_<server-name>.go`. The connection to the data backend is made in these handlers. Other configuration such as middleware setup is also written in this file, in its respective methods.

##### Adding New Paths

To prevent overwrite of the backend implementation, the `restapi/configure_<server-name>.go` file is not re-generated if it already exists. Therefore, if new paths are added in the `swagger.yml` file, new handlers for those paths will not be automatically generated into the existing `restapi/configure_<server-name>.go` file. Moving the existing file to a different directory will allow swagger to generate the configuration file with the up-to-date set of handlers upon the next call of `swagger generate server`. The two copies of the file can then be reconciled to include both the new handlers and the previously-implemented ones. 

#### Boilerplate Code and Directory Structure

All files in the api directory are auto-generated (and auto-replaced upon calling
`$ swagger generate server <path-to-target-swagger.yml>`) except for the following:
- swagger.yml: The swagger definition.
- configure_variant_service.go: Auto-generated but safe to edit.
- main: Generated by calling `$ go build cmd/model-vs-server/main.go`

The auto-generated boilerplate code includes:
- models
The API-facing models for entities are generated into the `models` package.
Models are generated from the `definitions` defined in the `swagger.yml` file.
- endpoints
The endpoints for the API are defined in `paths` in the `swagger.yml` file, and from their definition the `operations` package is populated with endpoint parameters, validation, responses, URL building, etc.
However the backend handlers for these endpoints, ie. what is done with the received request, must be written manually in confifure_variant_service.go, in the configureAPI method. By default, the handlers return 501: Not Implemented responses.
- server
The go server files and main.go are auto-generated.
- configuration
The `configure_variant_service.go` file is auto-generated but safe to edit. This is where the manually written backend goes, where requests are handled following their automatic transformation into go stucts, and where responses/payloads are assigned.
Middleware can be plugged in here.
The connection to the data backend/memory store (ie. the ORM and/or database) should be made here.

### GoBuffalo Pop

Pop is an ORM-like that is used to interface between a go backend and one of several database languages. 

See the [pop README](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop#pop--) for installation and use instructions. There is also an [Unofficial pop Book](https://andrew-sledge.gitbooks.io/the-unofficial-pop-book/content/) with tutorials, [Quick Start](https://andrew-sledge.gitbooks.io/the-unofficial-pop-book/content/installation.html) being a good place to begin.

Since the database used in this project is `sqlite3`, there are slight modifications that must be made to some commands in the form of a `-tags sqlite` option. These are detailed in the [Installing CLI Support](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop#installing-cli-support) section of the Pop documentation.

#### Pop Migrations

Soda is a CLI tool for generating pop migration files and models, as well as for running up- and down-migrations. Migrations are described in `.fizz` or `.sql` files, and beyond simple migrations such as adding/dropping columns, these files must be manually populated with explicit migration instructions.

Fizz provides a Go-like syntax for writing migrations, but [you may instead opt for writing SQL migrations as desired](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop#generating-migrations). The fizz syntax is described [here](https://github.com/markbates/pop/tree/master/fizz).

##### Migrating Pop Models

Soda can generate models in pop from command-line input, but these models must be manually edited when migrations cause modifications to the database table that a model corresponds to.

For example, if you add a `province` column to the `individual` table in a migration, the `individual.go` model must have that field added to its `type Individual struct`. You may also want to add validations for this new field in the `Validate` method of the `individual.go` model.

#### Validating Pop Models

`Validate` method contained in each model Go file is called upon each `ValidateAndSave` (or similar) call, to ensure that the data about to be entered in the database meets developer-defined constraints.

The `validators` package from Gobuffalo [validate](https://github.com/gobuffalo/validate) is the only set of validators automatically imported by Pop, but this `validate` framework allows for the creation of custom validators as needed. See the `tools/validators` directory for a simple example, or  the Unofficial pop Book's tutorial on [Writin Validations](https://andrew-sledge.gitbooks.io/the-unofficial-pop-book/content/advanced-topics/writing-validations.html) for a more complex example.

#### Handling Nulls With Pop

There is some complexity introduced in representing database tables with Go structs. Since Go only allows `nil` values for pointers, one must employ a work-around for handling nulls retrieved from the database, which is particularly necessary for validating their presence or absence.

By default, null-values from the database are transformed into Go's zero-values for a column that is represented in Go by a non-nillable type. For example, the `Chromosome` field of the `Variant` model (in `variant.go`) is of type string, and if a value for `chromosome` is not supplied in an entry, the value of the `Chromosome` field is `""`. The `validators` package used to validate *required* fields in pop only checks for these fields having a non-zero value.

This project uses the `pop/nulls` package to handle non-nullable fields that should be permitted to have zero values, such as the `Start` field of the `Variant` model. This field is of type nulls.Int, which is able to support null values (and therefore a custom `int_is_not_null.go` validator.)

### Genny

Genny is a code-generation solution to the lack of generics in Go. We use it handle the myriad of similarly-named auto-generated go files created by the pop and Go-Swagger tools.

See the [genny README](https://github.com/CanDIG/genny#genny---generics-for-go) for usage instructions and examples. It operates essentially like a copy-then-search-and-replace for generating typed functions out of functions written for generic types. This reduces code duplication by allowing for the development of type-agnostic code.

Run `$ model-vs/api/generate_handlers.sh` to re-generate the handlers in the `github.com/CanDIG/go-model-service/model-vs/api/restapi/handlers` package.

There remain several issues with the genny tool that block the complete integration of generic code-gen into our project. Please contribute to the resolution of these issues in our [genny](https://github.com/CanDIG/genny/issues) repository.
